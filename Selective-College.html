	<h2>Access to Selective Colleges</h2>


	<p>Selective colleges are colleges that are in great demand yet typically admit a very small percentage of students who apply. The image below shows the acceptance rate for selective colleges.</p>

	<p>Highly selective colleges look for three things in students: academics, extracurriculars, and diversity.</p>

  <br>
	
  <h3>Academic Achievement</h3>


	<p>The possibility of one getting into a college largely depends on one's GPA and SAT score. Even though
    many selective schools don’t set a minimum GPA and SAT score, students should still aim for a GPA above 3.8 and a
    high SAT score. The picture below is an ideal graph of GPA and SAT scores for students applying to selective colleges.</p>

	</p>


	<p>As the graph shows, even with a perfect GPA and SAT, it might not be enough for selective schools. 
    Colleges also look for extra curriculars like sports, volunteer work, and clubs.</p>
  
  <br>
  <h3>Extracurriculars</h3>
	
  <p>The number of activities students are involved in isn’t necessarily what admission officers
    look for. Instead, the meaning of the activity or changes the activity has brought 
    to the student is more important. Some extracurriculars, such as music and sports 
    are more popular than others among students and parents for admission reasons.
    College admission officers appreciate students with music talents, but the number
    of those students is greatly over the numbers of music students that will be accepted.
    Music is not a good choice for students who don’t like music. Students should choose
    their extracurriculars by their personal interests- something they are really passionate about.

  <h3>Diversity</h3>


	<p><img src="http://www.unzcloud.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/AsianEnrollmentTrends.jpg" width="800px">
	</p>

	<p>Selective colleges want to bring diversity to their campus, and keep the number of students of each race similar 
    to the population of the country. Inevitably, the typical asian students will have a disadvantage toward the admission of selective colleges.</p>
  
  <p>The picture below shows the racial advantage or disadvantage students might have in college admission process. </p>

	</p>
  <p>On the other hand, because black and Hispanic students are underrepresented among bachelor’s degree
    recipients relative to their representation in the general population, black and Hispanic students usually have an advantage.</p>
  <p>
    Diversity can also be defined by character and interests. Being unique can be 
    prominent to admission officers. Colleges don’t want their student body to 
    have the same interest and play the same instrument. One might realize
    all the things above are somehow related to family background.</p>
  
  <br>
	<h3>Family Background</h3>
  
	<p>Family background influences students' interests which later influence their careers. 
    Students are most easily influenced by their parents' careers. For example, if a 
    student’s parents are both involved in music, the student is very likely to be
    a musician in the future. Also, if one’s parents went to the school one applies to, 
    there is a better chance that he or she get accepted to the school because he or 
    she is a legacy of the school and is likely to be more involved in the school and 
    more likely to donate to the school later on.</p>

	</p>

	<p>Family wealth also greatly influences a student’s chance of getting into selective colleges. 
    Although selective colleges try to make their student body more diverse, students 
    from higher socioeconomic backgrounds still have an advantage. Wealthy students have better 
    resources, high schools, and usually more family pressure to get into highly selective schools. 
    They are able to have the opportunity to develop their 
    extracurriculars when they are young due to their personal interests.</p>
