	<h2>Selective Colleges</h2>
	<img src="https://www.youniversitytv.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/How-selective-are-colleges-really-1024x768.jpg" width="500px">

	<p>Socioeconomic stratification is correlated to possibility of acceptance. 
    Among high school students from 2004, sixty-nine percent of those who 
    enrolled at the “most competitive” institutions were from families in 
    the top socioeconomic quartile, while only 4 percent were from families 
    in the bottom quartile. What is the most important for selective colleges? 
    Is family background a great factor of enrollment at those institutions?
    How can an ordinary student get into those schools?<br>
