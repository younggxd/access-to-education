	<p>While attending a public university as an out-of-state student, it can sometimes cost up to nearly three times more than in-state tuition. Also some states give less financial aid and that could make it even harder to afford to go to that college. People today like to travel because they don't want to stay in the same place all their life. You can have the highest GPA and the best test scores, but most likely can not go to to college out of state because you're not a resident. Also, it's proven that the merit waivers may not even cover everything to make it the most affordable as it can be.</p>

					<p>Public colleges receive money from the government of the state where they are located and often offer a lower tuition for students who are residents of that state. Private colleges don't receive government funding and have one tuition for everyone. So the government is funding public schools, and they are requesting more money from the students to fill the gaps that the government hasn't. The national student loan average is 1.3 trillion dollars which could go down if they didn't have to pay extra from coming out of state. Many prospective students are looking for cost-effective routes to a postsecondary degree. While attending a public college as an out-of-state student has traditionally meant an exorbitant price hike, many public institutions are leveling the playing field by offering competitive rates for all students; some offer residents and non-residents the same tuition, while others charge only slightly more.</p>

		<p>There are some expenses that come with going to an out of state college. Some people have to find a new medical coverage company because they don't have access to their old one. Also people would have to get a plane ticket or they would need to get gas money to drive to the states, which would be very costly if you live far away from the college. Also, if they would like to know about the diversity of the school, it would be good for that person to walk around and see it for themselves.</p>
