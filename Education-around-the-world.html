	<h1>Where is the "MONEY" coming from?</h1>


	<p>In Germany, college is so called "free." Even Americans can get a free education in another country. Although a lot of people say that Germany’s education is free, you still have to pay a small fee called a registration fee. The average cost is 250 euros that is about $273 in American currency. Taxes are much higher in Germany than in the U.S which allows the educational system to make it easier for the students to afford the education. The cost is $600 a year.</p>

	<p>The government normally doesn't spend as much money towards education compared to the defense department. Most people don't mind because when the government is lacking in the states and the local area make up for it. People think it's okay because they are only investing $15,000 per kid every year. Teachers are underpaid and schools are underpaid. Schools don't have enough funding. They also claim that “many stimulus dollars went to help struggling states and school districts after the housing bubble popped and the financial collapse, and this was a good thing.”</p>

	<p>According to 2010 figures from the Office of Management and Budget, "we're set to spend 20 percent of our federal budget on defense and a mere 3 percent on education."</p>

					<p>It is true that we spend a lot of money on education and defense. Still it isn't enough-- we would rather spend money on weapons than shaping young minds. Children are our future and we need to give them the best chance of improving. </p>

	<p>In the 2008 school year, before the recession took hold, in at least 15 states the cuts exceeded by 10%. Roughly around 31 states provided less funding per students in the 2014 school year. Nearly 18 states had funding that fell in the same time period. In at least 27 states, local funding rose, but those increases rarely made up for cuts in state support. Even though the 2016 school year data is not accessible right now, 25 states are still providing less “general” or “formula” funding. In seven states, the cuts exceeded 10%.</p>


	<h1>We are getting there...!</h1>


	<p>The majority of the states raised funding per student slightly this year but still 12 states imposed cuts. Even though we are in a better economy, some of those states including Oklahoma, Arizona, and Wisconsin already were among the deepest-cutting states since the recession hit.</p>
